New IOT =temp.Model
IIoT 4.0 is coming to cover all enterprise monitoring and maintenance system. Thus, we need bold and sustainable algorithms and approaches to analyze the IOT sensor data and find hidden patterns and insights. Heat Index ( temperature + humidity ) is one common data recorded on these IOT readers. The frequency of the upcoming data is very fast. The sensor reads hundreds to millions of data per second. There is a huge and versatile application of this data in real world. like:- Agriculture, weather forecasting, soil monitoring and treatment, enterprise maintenance, Data centres, and many moreâ€¦
This dataset contains the temperature readings from IOT devices installed outside and inside of an anonymous Room (say - admin room). The device was in the alpha testing phase. So, It was uninstalled or shut off several times during the entire reading period ( 28-07-2018 to 08-12-2018). This random interval recordings and few mis-readings ( outliers) makes it more challanging to perform analysis on this data. Let's see, what you can present in the plate out of this messy data.
